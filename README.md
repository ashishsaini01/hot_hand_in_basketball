## Hot Hand in Basketball – Data Analysis

This project was created as part of a master’s seminar on sports journalism and data science. Our team explored the “Hot Hand” phenomenon in basketball – the belief that a player who makes several shots in a row is more likely to keep scoring.

While journalism students focused on writing the sports publication, our task (data science side) was to scrape, clean, model, and visualize the data to support storytelling with intuitive and engaging graphics.

## Project Overview

Topic: Hot Hand in Basketball – Is the winning streak real?

Case Study: NBA Playoffs 2022 (players: Maxi Kleber, Luka Doncic, Chris Paul, Giannis Antetokounmpo)

Goal: Provide statistical insights and visualizations to test whether the “Hot Hand” exists.

## Data

Source: basketball-reference.com, nba.com

Data included: player game logs, shot outcomes, shooting streaks, and advanced metrics.

## Methods

Data Collection: Web scraping and structured datasets

Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, filtering playoff games, and standardizing shot data

## Modeling:

Shooting probability after makes vs. misses

Streak detection (hot and cold runs)

Player/team impact analysis (+/– statistics)

## Visualization:

Bar charts for shooting percentages after streaks

Dot plots for shot makes/misses

Comparative team performance visuals

## Results

Mixed Evidence:

Some players (e.g., Maxi Kleber) showed patterns resembling a “Hot Hand.”

For others (e.g., Giannis), consistency or “cold streaks” told a different story.

Key Insight: The “Hot Hand” is often context-dependent (teammates, defenders, game situation).
